# Manpage on Globbing

## Recursive Globbing

A pathname component of the form ‘(foo/)#' matches a path consisting of zero or more directories matching the pattern foo.

       As a shorthand, ‘**/' is equivalent to ‘(*/)#'; note that this therefore matches files in the current directory as well as subdirectories.  Thus:

              ls -ld -- (*/)#bar

       or

              ls -ld -- **/bar

       does a recursive directory search for files named ‘bar' (potentially including the file ‘bar' in the current directory).  This form does not follow symbolic links; the alternative
       form  ‘***/'  does, but is otherwise identical.  Neither of these can be combined with other forms of globbing within the same path segment; in that case, the ‘*' operators revert
       to their usual effect.

       Even shorter forms are available when the option GLOB_STAR_SHORT is set.  In that case if no / immediately follows a ** or *** they are treated as if both a / plus a further * are
       present.  Hence:

              setopt GLOBSTARSHORT
              ls -ld -- **.c

       is equivalent to

              ls -ld -- **/*.c

## Glob Qualifiers

Patterns used for filename generation may end in a list of qualifiers enclosed in parentheses. The qualifiers specify which filenames that otherwise match the given pattern will
be inserted in the argument list.

   if the option BARE_GLOB_QUAL is set, then a trailing set of parentheses containing no ‘|' or ‘(' characters (or ‘~' if it is special) is taken as a set of glob qualifiers.  A glob
       subexpression  that  would  normally  be taken as glob qualifiers, for example ‘(^x)', can be forced to be treated as part of the glob pattern by doubling the parentheses, in this
       case producing ‘((^x))'.

   If the option EXTENDED_GLOB is set, a different syntax for glob qualifiers is available, namely ‘(#qx)' where x is any of the same glob qualifiers used in the other  format.   The
       qualifiers  must still appear at the end of the pattern.  However, with this syntax multiple glob qualifiers may be chained together.  They are treated as a logical AND of the in‐
       dividual sets of flags.  Also, as the syntax is unambiguous, the expression will be treated as glob qualifiers just as long any parentheses contained within it are  balanced;  ap‐
       pearance  of  ‘|', ‘(' or ‘~' does not negate the effect.  Note that qualifiers will be recognised in this form even if a bare glob qualifier exists at the end of the pattern, for
       example ‘*(#q*)(.)' will recognise executable regular files if both options are set; however, mixed syntax should probably be avoided for the sake of clarity.   Note  that  within
       conditions  using  the  ‘[[' form the presence of a parenthesised expression (#q...) at the end of a string indicates that globbing should be performed; the expression may include
       glob qualifiers, but it is also valid if it is simply (#q).  This does not apply to the right hand side of pattern match operators as the syntax already has special significance.

   A qualifier may be any one of the following:

       /      directories

       F      ‘full' (i.e. non-empty) directories.  Note that the opposite sense (^F) expands to empty directories and all non-directories.  Use (/^F) for empty directories.

       .      plain files

       @      symbolic links

       =      sockets

       p      named pipes (FIFOs)

       *      executable plain files (0100 or 0010 or 0001)

       %      device files (character or block special)

       %b     block special files

       %c     character special files

       r      owner-readable files (0400)

       w      owner-writable files (0200)

       x      owner-executable files (0100)

       A      group-readable files (0040)

       I      group-writable files (0020)

       E      group-executable files (0010)

       R      world-readable files (0004)

       W      world-writable files (0002)

       X      world-executable files (0001)

       s      setuid files (04000)

       S      setgid files (02000)

       t      files with the sticky bit (01000)

       fspec  files with access rights matching spec. This spec may be a octal number optionally preceded by a ‘=', a ‘+', or a ‘-'. If none of these characters is given, the behavior is
              the same as for ‘='. The octal number describes the mode bits to be expected, if combined with a ‘=', the value given must match the file-modes  exactly,  with  a  ‘+',  at
              least  the bits in the given number must be set in the file-modes, and with a ‘-', the bits in the number must not be set. Giving a ‘?' instead of a octal digit anywhere in
              the number ensures that the corresponding bits in the file-modes are not checked, this is only useful in combination with ‘='.

              If the qualifier ‘f' is followed by any other character anything up to the next matching character (‘[', ‘{', and ‘<' match ‘]', ‘}', and ‘>' respectively, any other  char‐
              acter  matches  itself)  is  taken as a list of comma-separated sub-specs. Each sub-spec may be either an octal number as described above or a list of any of the characters
              ‘u', ‘g', ‘o', and ‘a', followed by a ‘=', a ‘+', or a ‘-', followed by a list of any of the characters ‘r', ‘w', ‘x', ‘s', and ‘t', or an octal digit. The  first  list  of
              characters  specify which access rights are to be checked. If a ‘u' is given, those for the owner of the file are used, if a ‘g' is given, those of the group are checked, a
              ‘o' means to test those of other users, and the ‘a' says to test all three groups. The ‘=', ‘+', and ‘-' again says how the modes are to be checked and have the same  mean‐
              ing as described for the first form above. The second list of characters finally says which access rights are to be expected: ‘r' for read access, ‘w' for write access, ‘x'
              for the right to execute the file (or to search a directory), ‘s' for the setuid and setgid bits, and ‘t' for the sticky bit.

              Thus,  ‘*(f70?)'  gives  the files for which the owner has read, write, and execute permission, and for which other group members have no rights, independent of the permis‐
              sions for other users. The pattern ‘*(f-100)' gives all files for which the owner does not have execute permission, and ‘*(f:gu+w,o-rx:)' gives  the  files  for  which  the
              owner and the other members of the group have at least write permission, and for which other users don't have read or execute permission.

       estring
       +cmd   The  string  will  be  executed as shell code.  The filename will be included in the list if and only if the code returns a zero status (usually the status of the last com‐
              mand).

              In the first form, the first character after the ‘e' will be used as a separator and anything up to the next matching separator will be taken  as the string; ‘[', ‘{',  and
              ‘<'  match  ‘]', ‘}', and ‘>', respectively, while any other character matches itself. Note that expansions must be quoted in the string to prevent them from being expanded
              before globbing is done.  string is then executed as shell code.  The string globqual is appended to the array zsh_eval_context the duration of execution.

              During the execution of string the filename currently being tested is available in the parameter REPLY; the parameter may be altered to a string to  be  inserted  into  the
              list  instead  of  the original filename.  In addition, the parameter reply may be set to an array or a string, which overrides the value of REPLY.  If set to an array, the
              latter is inserted into the command line word by word.

              For example, suppose a directory contains a single file ‘lonely'.  Then the expression ‘*(e:'reply=(${REPLY}{1,2})':)' will cause the words ‘lonely1' and  ‘lonely2'  to  be
              inserted into the command line.  Note the quoting of string.

              The  form  +cmd has the same effect, but no delimiters appear around cmd.  Instead, cmd is taken as the longest sequence of characters following the + that are alphanumeric
              or underscore.  Typically cmd will be the name of a shell function that contains the appropriate test.  For example,

                     nt() { [[ $REPLY -nt $NTREF ]] }
                     NTREF=reffile
                     ls -ld -- *(+nt)

              lists all files in the directory that have been modified more recently than reffile.

       ddev   files on the device dev

       l[-|+]ct
              files having a link count less than ct (-), greater than ct (+), or equal to ct

       U      files owned by the effective user ID

       G      files owned by the effective group ID

       uid    files owned by user ID id if that is a number.  Otherwise, id specifies a user name: the character after the ‘u' will be taken as a separator and the string between it  and
              the  next  matching separator will be taken as a user name.  The starting separators ‘[', ‘{', and ‘<' match the final separators ‘]', ‘}', and ‘>', respectively; any other
              character matches itself.  The selected files are those owned by this user.  For example, ‘u:foo:' or ‘u[foo]' selects files owned by user ‘foo'.

       gid    like uid but with group IDs or names

       a[Mwhms][-|+]n
              files accessed exactly n days ago.  Files accessed within the last n days are selected using a negative value for n (-n).  Files accessed more than n days ago are  selected
              by a positive n value (+n).  Optional unit specifiers ‘M', ‘w', ‘h', ‘m' or ‘s' (e.g. ‘ah5') cause the check to be performed with months (of 30 days), weeks, hours, minutes
              or seconds instead of days, respectively.  An explicit ‘d' for days is also allowed.

              Any  fractional  part  of  the  difference between the access time and the current part in the appropriate units is ignored in the comparison.  For instance, ‘echo *(ah-5)'
              would echo files accessed within the last five hours, while ‘echo *(ah+5)' would echo files accessed at least six hours ago, as times strictly between five  and  six  hours
              are treated as five hours.

       m[Mwhms][-|+]n
              like the file access qualifier, except that it uses the file modification time.

       c[Mwhms][-|+]n
              like the file access qualifier, except that it uses the file inode change time.

       L[+|-]n
              files less than n bytes (-), more than n bytes (+), or exactly n bytes in length.

              If  this flag is directly followed by a size specifier ‘k' (‘K'), ‘m' (‘M'), or ‘p' (‘P') (e.g. ‘Lk-50') the check is performed with kilobytes, megabytes, or blocks (of 512
              bytes) instead.  (On some systems additional specifiers are available for gigabytes, ‘g' or ‘G', and terabytes, ‘t' or ‘T'.) If a size specifier is used a file is  regarded
              as  "exactly"  the  size if the file size rounded up to the next unit is equal to the test size.  Hence ‘*(Lm1)' matches files from 1 byte up to 1 Megabyte inclusive.  Note
              also that the set of files "less than" the test size only includes files that would not match the equality test; hence ‘*(Lm-1)' only matches files of zero size.

       ^      negates all qualifiers following it

       -      toggles between making the qualifiers work on symbolic links (the default) and the files they point to, if any; any symbolic link for whose target the  ‘stat'  system  call
              fails (whatever the cause of the failure) is treated as a file in its own right

       M      sets the MARK_DIRS option for the current pattern

       T      appends a trailing qualifier mark to the filenames, analogous to the LIST_TYPES option, for the current pattern (overrides M)

       N      sets the NULL_GLOB option for the current pattern

       D      sets the GLOB_DOTS option for the current pattern

       n      sets the NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT option for the current pattern

       Yn     enables  short-circuit  mode:  the  pattern will expand to at most n filenames.  If more than n matches exist, only the first n matches in directory traversal order will be
              considered.

              Implies oN when no oc qualifier is used.

       oc     specifies how the names of the files should be sorted. The following values of c sort in the following ways:

              n      By name.
              L      By the size (length) of the files.
              l      By number of links.
              a      By time of last access, youngest first.
              m      By time of last modification, youngest first.
              c      By time of last inode change, youngest first.
              d      By directories: files in subdirectories appear before those in the current directory at each level of the search -- this is best combined with  other  criteria,  for
                     example ‘odon' to sort on names for files within the same directory.
              N      No sorting is performed.
              estring
              +cmd   Sort by shell code (see below).

              Note  that the modifiers ^ and - are used, so ‘*(^-oL)' gives a list of all files sorted by file size in descending order, following any symbolic links.  Unless oN is used,
              multiple order specifiers may occur to resolve ties.

              The default sorting is n (by name) unless the Y glob qualifier is used, in which case it is N (unsorted).

              oe and o+ are special cases; they are each followed by shell code, delimited as for the e glob qualifier and the + glob qualifier respectively (see above).  The code is ex‐
              ecuted for each matched file with the parameter REPLY set to the name of the file on entry and globsort appended to zsh_eval_context.  The code should modify the  parameter
              REPLY  in  some fashion.  On return, the value of the parameter is used instead of the file name as the string on which to sort.  Unlike other sort operators, oe and o+ may
              be repeated, but note that the maximum number of sort operators of any kind that may appear in any glob expression is 12.

       Oc     like ‘o', but sorts in descending order; i.e. ‘*(^oc)' is the same as ‘*(Oc)' and ‘*(^Oc)' is the same as ‘*(oc)'; ‘Od' puts files in the current directory before those  in
              subdirectories at each level of the search.

       [beg[,end]]
              specifies which of the matched filenames should be included in the returned list. The syntax is the same as for array subscripts. beg and the optional end may be mathemati‐
              cal  expressions.  As  in  parameter subscripting they may be negative to make them count from the last match backward. E.g.: ‘*(-OL[1,3])' gives a list of the names of the
              three largest files.

       Pstring
              The string will be prepended to each glob match as a separate word.  string is delimited in the same way as arguments to the e glob qualifier described above.   The  quali‐
              fier  can be repeated; the words are prepended separately so that the resulting command line contains the words in the same order they were given in the list of glob quali‐
              fiers.

              A typical use for this is to prepend an option before all occurrences of a file name; for example, the pattern ‘*(P:-f:)' produces the command line arguments ‘-f  file1  -f
              file2 ...'

              If the modifier ^ is active, then string will be appended instead of prepended.  Prepending and appending is done independently so both can be used on the same glob expres‐
              sion; for example by writing ‘*(P:foo:^P:bar:^P:baz:)' which produces the command line arguments ‘foo baz file1 bar ...'

       More  than one of these lists can be combined, separated by commas. The whole list matches if at least one of the sublists matches (they are ‘or'ed, the qualifiers in the sublists
       are ‘and'ed).  Some qualifiers, however, affect all matches generated, independent of the sublist in which they are given.  These are the qualifiers ‘M', ‘T', ‘N', ‘D', ‘n',  ‘o',
       ‘O' and the subscripts given in brackets (‘[...]').

       If a ‘:' appears in a qualifier list, the remainder of the expression in parenthesis is interpreted as a modifier (see the section ‘Modifiers' in the section ‘History Expansion').
       Each  modifier must be introduced by a separate ‘:'.  Note also that the result after modification does not have to be an existing file.  The name of any existing file can be fol‐
       lowed by a modifier of the form ‘(:...)' even if no actual filename generation is performed, although note that the presence of the parentheses causes the entire expression to  be
       subjected to any global pattern matching options such as NULL_GLOB. Thus:

## Examples

>        ls -ld -- *(-/)

lists all directories and symbolic links that point to directories, and

>        ls -ld -- *(-@)

lists all broken symbolic links, and

>        ls -ld -- *(%W)

lists all world-writable device files in the current directory, and

        ls -ld -- *(W,X)

lists all files in the current directory that are world-writable or world-executable, and

>        print -rC1 /tmp/foo*(u0^@:t)

outputs the basename of all root-owned files beginning with the string ‘foo' in /tmp, ignoring symlinks, and

>        ls -ld -- *.*~(lex|parse).[ch](^D^l1)

lists all files having a link count of one whose names contain a dot (but not those starting with a dot, since GLOB_DOTS is explicitly switched off) except for lex.c, lex.h,
parse.c and parse.h.

> print -rC1 b\*.pro(#q:s/pro/shmo/)(#q.:s/builtin/shmiltin/)
>
> demonstrates how colon modifiers and other qualifiers may be chained together. The ordinary qualifier ‘.' is applied first, then the colon modifiers in order from left to right.
> So if EXTENDED_GLOB is set and the base pattern matches the regular file builtin.pro, the shell will print ‘shmiltin.shmo'.
